# Tweets_Sentiment_Analysis

• Developed a model to extract the tweets of any given set of hashtags and transform the data using natural language techniques with nltk packages in python. Applied modelling techniques such as Naïve Bayes to predict the sentiment and emotion classifications of the all the extracted tweets. Visualized geographical scatter plot for the classified sentiments, bar graphs for classified emotions and the word clouds for the given hashtags
• Used (Python- tweepy, pandas, numpy, wordcloud, geopy, nltk, re) for data processing and Matplotlib, bokeh for visualizations


*****Requirements for using the application******
1. Anaconda Python Distribution - Version 3.6 https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. Below are the Python libraries needed to be installed. Please use command pip install "library name" using Anaconda Command Prompt.
- bokeh
- nltk
- numpy
- sys
- operator
- collections
- copy
- re
- PIL
- wordcloud
- tweepy
- pandas
- geopy
- json
- os
- matplotlib
3. Please keep the FBleak.ipynb, Projectrun.ipynb, Catogeries.csv and twittermask.jpg in the same folder.

*****How to******
1. Unzip the folder in the location accessible by Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the Projectrun.ipynb and run all the cell froms top to bottom.
3. After running the last cell, there will be 2 tabs - one shows list of already collected and analysied tweets and the 
   second tab takes input as hashtags.
4. As this will the first time the application will be running, there wont be any data for first tab. So please use the second
   tab to generate the results. (It may take upto 30 mins as the data collection is involved for each hashtag entered"
5. Once the data is generated and results produced, it will be avilable for the first tab in dropdownlist for later use.
6. We are already providing some data, to populate the dropdown menu.
